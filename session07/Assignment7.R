# Assignment 7

# download the vaccine_distribution.csv file from the blackboard. 


# import the dataset 


# create a new column with the total number of doses (1st + 2nd)


# plot a histogram to observe the distribution of the total dose allocations. 
# Play with the number of bins or the binwidth to get a better visualization


# create a dot plot to compare the number of first dose allocations vs second dose allocations


# create a boxplot to observe the distribution of first dose allocations per jurisdiction


# Use tidyverse functions to calculate the average number of total doses per jurisdiction, 
# then use the result to create a dot plot comparing the average number of doses vs jurisdiction
